LIGO Channel Information System client
======================================

The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) runs a network of kilometre-scale, dual-recycled interferometers with Fabry-perot arm cavities in order to detect and study gravitational waves of astrophysical origin.

The LIGO Channel Information System (CIS) is a web service archiving information about each of the ~100,000 instrumental control and error signals and environmental sensor readings used to operate and characterise data quality.
